# My Solutions for Exercism.io challenges

This repo is a collection of my solutions for the challenges found on [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/).

While the site does let you look through your solutions and the solutions of others I find it's more fun to have everything on Github.
Plus this way, due to the fact that all the problems have required the same configuration for babel and jest, I can not have to have an individual config and node_modules folder for every problem.

#### Testing
Call `yarn run test:dir -u DIRECTORY` to run tests for a specific problem
